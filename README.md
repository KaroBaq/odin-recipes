# odin-recipes
In this project we created a basic recipe website. It contains a main page with links to three different recipes. Each page recipe has a link to go back to the main page. We also added images.

The purpose of this project is to practice all the lessons viewed at the html course, such as the basic boilerplate for an html, how to add headings, paragraphs, links, lists, and images.
